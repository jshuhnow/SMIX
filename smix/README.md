PyTorch implementation of "[SMIX(λ): Enhancing Centralized Value Functions for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/xtan/paper/AAAI-WenC.2318.pdf)". If you use our code please cite the paper.



## Installation

SMIX(λ) is tested on [SMAC](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac) environment. The installation procedure is the same as [pymarl](https://github.com/oxwhirl/pymarl).



## Run SMIX(λ)

Run SMIX(λ) on 3s5z map:

```shell
python3 src/main.py --config=smix --env-config=sc2 with env_args.map_name=3s5z
```
